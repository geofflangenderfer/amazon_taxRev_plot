# Amazon Tax Revenue Impact on NYC and VA

![Amazon Impact: NYC/VA](graph.jpg)

Amazon will be building a new HQ spread between NYC, VA, and Nasheville. 
I was interested to know how this would benefit these areas, so I used the info
Amazon provided in a blog post and assumed a linear realization of the projected 
tax revenue and subsidy.
